vraag,"Due to the export of raw materials, some countries are unable to develop a processing industry. Explain how this development trap works and why it is difficult to escape from it."
modelantwoord_deel1_prefix,The development trap works as follows:
modelantwoord_deel1_completion,"When countries mainly export raw materials, they often receive too little profit to invest in a processing industry. As a result, they remain dependent on exporting these raw commodities."
modelantwoord_deel2_prefix,This trap is difficult to escape because:
modelantwoord_deel2_completion,"Establishing a processing industry requires substantial investments, expertise, and stable markets. Additionally, wealthy countries often keep high import tariffs on processed goods while allowing raw materials to enter duty-free."

1,Emma de Vries,The development trap works because:,"These countries export raw materials at low prices, while importing expensive finished products. The profits from raw exports are too small to build their own processing facilities.",It's hard to break out of this trap because:,"Powerful countries and corporations benefit from this system and maintain it through trade agreements and economic pressure. They often impose higher tariffs on processed goods than raw materials.",1,1,2,95,"export:high,raw materials:high,profits:high,processing:high","tariffs:high,powerful:medium,trade:medium,processed:high","deel1:Countries get stuck exporting raw materials at low prices and can't earn enough to invest in processing industries.|deel2:Wealthy nations and corporations maintain this system by charging higher tariffs on processed goods than on raw materials.|score_deel1:1|score_deel2:1;deel1:The trap happens when countries only export unprocessed resources for low prices while buying back expensive finished products.|deel2:The trap is maintained by international trade agreements that favor developed nations, making it hard for developing countries to build their own industries.|score_deel1:1|score_deel2:1"
2,Thomas Bakker,De ontwikkelingsval werkt als volgt:,"Landen exporteren grondstoffen tegen lage prijzen en importeren dure eindproducten. Ze krijgen te weinig winst om een verwerkingsindustrie op te bouwen.",Deze val is moeilijk te doorbreken omdat:,"Rijke landen hebben voordeel bij dit systeem en houden het in stand door handelsbarrières.

3,Sophie Jansen,This trap occurs because:,"Countries export unprocessed resources but don't have money to build processing industries. They remain poor selling cheap raw materials.",Escaping this trap is difficult because:,"Building processing facilities requires lots of money and expertise, which these countries don't have. Also, they lack access to markets.",1,0,1,75,"export:high,unprocessed:high,poor:medium,cheap:medium","money:medium,expertise:medium,markets:high,facilities:medium","deel1:When countries mainly export raw materials, they get too little profit to invest in processing industries.|deel2:It requires substantial investments in technology and infrastructure, and often faces resistance from established global market players.|score_deel1:1|score_deel2:1;deel1:Countries get trapped exporting raw materials for low prices instead of developing processing industries.|deel2:Lack of capital and expertise makes it hard to develop processing industries.|score_deel1:1|score_deel2:0"
4,Daan Visser,The development trap is:,"Some countries can only export raw materials at low prices, which doesn't give them enough money to invest in factories to process those materials.",It's hard to escape because:,"These countries face high entry barriers to global markets.",0,0,0,65,"export:medium,low prices:medium,money:medium,factories:medium","entry barriers:medium,global markets:medium","deel1:Countries with mainly raw material exports earn too little to invest in processing industries.|deel2:Breaking out requires capital, knowledge, and access to markets, all of which are difficult to acquire when trapped in raw material dependency.|score_deel1:1|score_deel2:1;deel1:The trap happens when a country only exports unprocessed resources and can't afford to build industries.|deel2:Developed countries protect their industries with tariffs, making it hard for developing nations.|score_deel1:0|score_deel2:1"
5,Julia Vermeer,The development trap works as follows:,"When countries depend on exporting raw materials, they receive lower profits compared to processed goods. This prevents them from developing their own processing industries.",This trap is difficult to escape because:,"Developed countries impose high import tariffs on processed goods while allowing raw materials in duty-free.
